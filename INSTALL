Thanks for downloading django-composite-field.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory::

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``pip`` utility available, you can type the
following to download and install in one step::

    pip install django-composite-field

Or if you're using ``pipenv``::

    pipenv install django-composite-field

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``composite_field``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from somewhere
on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a Git
checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 3.4 or later, and a
functional installation of Django 1.8 or newer. You can obtain Python
from https://www.python.org/ and Django from https://www.djangoproject.com/.
