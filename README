CompositeField for Django Models
================================

This is an implementation of a CompositeField for Django. Composite fields
can be used to group fields together and reuse their definitions.

Example:

    class CoordField(CompositeField):
        x = models.FloatField()
        y = models.FloatField()

    class Place(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=10)
        coord = CoordField()

    p = Place(name='Foo', coord_x=42, coord_y=0)
    q = Place(name='Foo', coord=p.coord)
    q.coord.y = 42

The content of composite fields are stored inside the model, so they do
not have to fiddle with any internals of the Django models. For example
'p.coord' returns a proxy object that maps the fields 'x' and 'y'
to the model fields 'coord_x' and 'coord_y'. The proxy objekt also makes
it possible to assign more than one property at once.

There are some more examples in the included tests.py.
